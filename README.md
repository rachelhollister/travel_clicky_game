# Travel Clicky Game

A simple Travel themed memory game created with React. This was done through the UI split into components, managing the states, and responding to user events. Once the user starts this react app, they will see (12) different travel images, each listening for a click event. Upon a click this will affect the users score, they either keep clicking new images to gain a point, or they click a duplicate image and have lose having to start over. The application also keeps track of the highest score the user got. 

Since these images shuffle themselves randomly, this serves as a fun and simplistic memory game for the user.
